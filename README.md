# CalboVirus
This is a prank virus(I guess). It puts macarena song and an image as wallpaper, it takes like 1 min to download the image and the song. Then after that, while the song is playing, the lyrics are shown in screen(Not full lyrics, I was lazy), and It gliches a little bit the screen.



# Stuff to add
1. Make the program copy itself to C:\Windows\System32\, run the program and then, delete it from it's actual location.
2. Idk.
