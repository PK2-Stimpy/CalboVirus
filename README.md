# USSR Fake Virus v2.0.0
This is a prank virus(I guess). It puts USSR song and an image as wallpaper, it takes like 1 min to download the image and the song. Then after that, while the song is playing, the lyrics are shown in screen(Not full lyrics, I was lazy), and It gliches a little bit the screen. 

*v1.0.1* **->** Now it copies itself to C:\Calbus-(rand. num.), it runs the program and then it deletes itself.

*v1.0.2* **->** Now it creates a BSOD when the song ends.

*v2.0.0* **->** Changed name from CalboVirus to USSR Fake Virus, the macarena song got deleted and I wasn't able to download it again so R.I.P.
