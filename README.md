# CalboVirus
This is a prank virus(I guess). It puts macarena song and an image as wallpaper, it takes like 1 min to download the image and the song. Then after that, while the song is playing, the lyrics are shown in screen(Not full lyrics, I was lazy), and It gliches a little bit the screen. 

*v1.0.1* **->** Now it copies itself to C:\Calbus, it runs the program and then it deletes itself.
*v1.0.2* **->** Now it creates a BSOD when the song ends.

# Stuff to add
1. Add full lyrics.
2. Add more screen effects.
3. Tell me more things on my discord.
